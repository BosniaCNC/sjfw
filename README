ScribbleJ Firmware
(c) 2011 Christopher "ScribbleJ" Jansen

This is a firmware for 3D printers with an advanced gcode pipeline, capable of running at high speeds efficiently.

This firmware includes some portions which are copped directly from the MBI firmware, and some code that is based on
code in the Sprinter and Teacup firmwares.

THIS COMES WITH NO WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, PROMISES, OR CAKE.  I do not recommend that you, or anyone, uses this firmware.
If you do, you do so at your own risk.


SUPPORTED HARDWARE:
Prusa Reprap RAMPS1.2 (experimental!)
Prusa Reprap RAMPS1.3
Thing-O-Matic Gen4

FEATURES(now):
* Advanced Gcode Pipeline
* ISR driven movement
* Acceleration
* LCD Temperature Display
* "Volumteric" Printing
* SD Card support
-- Tested and working with "Pronterface" Reprap host, the best Reprap host there is presently.
-- This repository includes a perl-based "host.pl" which can be used as a host.

FEATURES(planned):
* Control panel
* Advanced movement calculations
* Sanguinololu Support

COMPILING AND INSTALLING:

Examine and edit the top of the Makefile to your satisfaction.  Optionally, look under
rampsXX/config.h or gen4/config.h to change the firmware settings.

make clean && make && make upload

IMPORTANT NOTES ON USING THIS FIRMWARE:

* There is no homing Gcode.  Make a move towards the endstops that is longer than the platform, then mark that spot 
with a G92 and carry on.

Here's my start.gcode from my Prusa:
------
M104 S180 (set extruder temperature to 180)
G92 X0 Y0 Z0 E0 (set current position to 0)
G1 X-300 Y-300 F2000 (move X+Y to endstops)
G1 Z-200 F400 (move Z to endstop)
G92 X0 Y0 Z0 E0 (set current position to 0)
G1 X0 Y0 Z30 F2000 (move to 0,0,30 to heat up)
M84 (disable all motors)
M109 S180 (set extruder temperature, wait)
------

Here's the start.gcode from my ToM:
------
M104 S180 (extruder to 180)
M140 S50 (bed to 50)
G92 X0 Y0 Z0 E0 (position 0)
G1 Z200 F400 (move Z to endstop)
G1 X-200 Y-200 F2000 (move x+Y to endstop)
G92 X-5 Y-25 Z116.68 E0 (set endstop positions)
G1 X0 Y0 Z50 (move to 0,0,50 to heat up)
M109 S180 (wait for hotend to reach 180)
------

* This firmware does NOT follow the standard Reprap gcode communication protocol, however the latest release has been
tested to work with the EXCELLENT "Pronterface" Host by Kliment:

CURRENTLY KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:

* Motors that are set to disable after a move only get disabled a few moves thereafter.  This should work fine, but
don't forget a M84 at the end of your gcode to turn off all motors.
